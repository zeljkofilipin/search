# Search Engine

## Page Object

This folder contains the base `Search` page object and a couple of child page objects, `Yandex` and `DuckDuckGo`. All common functionality is in `Search`. Child page objects contain search engine specific page elements and functionality. Other page objects are experiments that I didn't have the time to finish.
