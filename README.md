# Search Engine

Search for a keyword. Get the the first ten results. Get URL, title and description of each of the results.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine#Market_share), the most popular search engines are Google (92% market share), Bing (3%), Yahoo (2%), Baidu (1%), Yandex (1%) and DuckDuckGo (1%).

Google search results page always returned 10 search results, but it was surprisingly hard to parse. I didn't see any obvious was to find results. I could find URL and related title and I could find description, but separately. I could not find a good way to find all three.

Bing was strange. It sometimes returned less than 10 results, even for the same query.

Yahoo returned only one search result by default. 5 search results per page appeared after scrolling.

Baidu was all in Chinese. I could not find a way to switch the language.

Yandex was reasonable easy to automate.

DuckDuckGo was the easiest to automate. It always returned 10 results and it was easy to get the data.
